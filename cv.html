<div class="personal-statement">
	<p>I am an Engineering Manager with a strong technical background as a polyglot developer - understanding Java, Python, Node and PHP. I am capable of handling multiple remote teams, setting expectations, managing career goals and resolving day-to-day issues. Throughout my career working with such teams, in-person team building days occurred to enable a greater level of cohesion.</p>
